Introduction
============

CFFI bindings are available via the `deltachat <https://pypi.org/project/deltachat/>`_ Python package.
The package contains both the Python bindings and the Delta Chat core.
It is provided only for Linux.

The ``deltachat`` Python package provides two layers of bindings for the
core Rust-library of the https://delta.chat messaging ecosystem:
low-level CFFI bindings to the C interface of the Delta Chat core
and high-level Python bindings built on top of CFFI bindings.
