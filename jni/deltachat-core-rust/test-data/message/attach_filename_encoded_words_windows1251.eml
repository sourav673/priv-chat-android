testing encoded-words filenames with windows-1251 (cyrillic) encoding.

as a side-effect, this also tests that encoded words work together with
plain text as long as they're separated by spaces, see
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047 5.1:

"Ordinary ASCII text and 'encoded-word's may appear together in the
same header field.  However, an 'encoded-word' that appears in a
header field defined as '*text' MUST be separated from any adjacent
'encoded-word' or 'text' by 'linear-white-space'."
