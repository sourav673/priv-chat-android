this mail uses filename* in an invalid way,
not specifying chatset or language parts.

see https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2231, section 4.:
"Note also that the single quote delimiters MUST be present
even when one of the field values is omitted."

however, for now, Delta Chat is generous in this case,
just assuming encoded words
