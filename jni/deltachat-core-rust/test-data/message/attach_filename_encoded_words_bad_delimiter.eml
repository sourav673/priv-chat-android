there MUST be a space between encoded words and plain text,
if there is none, decoding should return the original string
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2047 5.1:

"Ordinary ASCII text and 'encoded-word's may appear together in the
same header field.  However, an 'encoded-word' that appears in a
header field defined as '*text' MUST be separated from any adjacent
'encoded-word' or 'text' by 'linear-white-space'."
